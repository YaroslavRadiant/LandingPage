              I have studied with the Open University and the College of
              Naturopathic Medicine in Brighton and London, which offered me a
              curriculum that aligned with my values by combining 21st century
              science with natural health philosophies. I am a Nutritional
              Therapist registered with the British Association of Lifestyle and
              Medicine (BANT) and regulated by the Complementary and Natural
              Healthcare Council (CNHC).

              I aim to explain the impact of a person’s environment and genetics
              in the manifestation and continuation of their health condition.
              Learning the ‘why' is the best tool you will ever have for long-term
              results. By not exclusively treating a symptom and looking to the
              root cause of illness we can see the role of habits, emotion,
              medical history and lifestyle choices in all individual cases.

            <p class="text work_together_sec_parag">
              By understanding more about the role of genes, experience and
              environment in your current state of ill/wellbeing you will see that
              you are not your diagnosis or a collection of symptoms. Working with
              me gives your physical and emotional needs the time and
              consideration necessary to explore the multifaceted nature of your
              condition.

                incredibly kind and supportive in regards to my eating disorder.
                She has provided me with an abundance of information and recipes,
                which has given me lots of inspiration in the kitchen. Her help
                with lifestyle habits, such as sleep, has added some ease and a
                sense of wellness to my daily life. The whole experience has been
